Blurry Loading Page + Solar System Simulation (Credit to https://github.com/M-AdilAhmad/2d-solar-system)

This project is a practice webpage that uses JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Eventually, we would like to display all planets in smaller screen sizes and add the option for the user to stop the planets' rotation, click on any planet, and info regarding the planet shows up.

Lessons Learned:
- Getting two elements on a page to work together: loading text and loading image

- Working with querySelector to edit our elements 

- Linking another page using JavaScript instead of html <a> tag = location.assign

This site is live at: https://blurrypage.netlify.app/
